1. Sendit Hub Problem - Sendit is a transport company that collects and delivers goods over a region comprising 14 cities. Each consignment of goods is transported from its source directly to its destination. The trips are made by relatively small vehicles. Sendit wants to change to a hub system. They plan to create two hubs. Transporting greater quantities of goods using larger trucks is at least 50% cheaper than using their smaller vehicles over the
same distance. Given the quantities of goods that need to be transported from each city
every week and the distances between cities, the problem is to determine in which cities
the two hubs should be located. The problem has been taken from Applications of optimizationwith Xpress-MP by Christelle Gu√©ret, Christian Prins, Marc Sevaux
